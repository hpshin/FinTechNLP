Otherwise the strings **“pony”** and **“ponies”** look like two totally different words to a computer.\n",

        "- In 2016, Google released a new dependency parser called *Parsey McParseface* which outperformed previous benchmarks using a new deep learning approach which quickly spread throughout the industry. Then a year later, they released an even newer model called ParseySaurus which improved things further. In other words, parsing techniques are still an active area of research and constantly changing and improving.\n",
        "- It’s also important to remember that many English sentences are ambiguous and just really hard to parse. In those cases, the model will make a guess based on what parsed version of the sentence seems most likely but it’s not perfect and sometimes the model will be embarrassingly wrong. But over time our NLP models will continue to get better at parsing text in a sensible way.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- There’s several **reasons why treating text as a classification problem instead of as an understanding problem tends to work really well** — even when using relatively simple linear classification models.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - First, **people constantly create and evolve language.** Especially in an online word full of memes and emoji, writing code to reliably parse tweets and user reviews is going to be pretty difficult.\n",
        "    - With text classification, **the algorithm doesn’t care whether the user wrote standard English, an emoji, or a reference to Goku**. **The algorithm is looking for statistical relationships between input phrases and outputs.** If writing ಠ_ಠ correlates more heavily with 1-star and 2-star reviews, the algorithm will pick that up even though it has no idea what a “look of disapproval” emoticon is. \n",
        "    - The classifier can still figure out **what characters mean in the context of where they appear and how often they contribute to a particular output.\n",
        "    - Second, **website users don’t always write in the specific language that you expect.** An NLP pipeline trained to handle American English is going to fall apart if you give it German text. It’s also going to do poorly if your user decides to write their reviews with Cockney Rhyming Slang — which is still technically English.\n",
        "    - Again, a  **classification algorithm doesn’t care what language the text is in as long as it can at least break apart the text into separate words and measure the effects of those words. As long as you give the classifier enough training data to cover a wide range of possible English and German user reviews**, it will learn to handle both just fine.\n",
        "    - And finally, a big reason that text classification is so great is because it is **fast**. **Because linear text classification algorithms are so simple (compared to more complex machine learning models like recurrent neural networks), they can be trained quickly.** You can train a linear classifier with gigabytes of text in minutes on a regular laptop. You don’t even need any fancy hardware like a GPU. So even if you can get a slightly better accuracy score with a different machine learning algorithm, sometimes the tradeoff isn’t worth it. And research has shown that often the accuracy gap is nearly zero anyway.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- While text classification models are simple to set up, that’s not to say they are always easy to get working well. The big catch is that you need **a lot of training data**. If you don’t have enough training data to cover the wide range of the ways that people write things, the model won’t ever be very accurate. \n",
        "- **The more training data you can collect, the better the model will perform.** The real art of applying text classification well is in finding clever ways of automatically collecting or creating training data.\n"

One that you probably use every day as a consumer without knowing it is the **email spam filtering** feature built into your email service. If you have a group of real emails marked as “spam” or “not spam”, you can use those to train a classification model that automatically flags spam emails in the future:\n",

        "- Classification is also useful for **sorting and labeling documents**. Imagine that your company has done thousands of consulting projects for clients but that your boss wants them all re-organized according to a new government-mandated project coding system. Instead of reading through every project’s summary document and trying to decide which project code is the best match, you could classify a random sampling of them by hand and then build a classification model to automatically code the remaining ones:\n",

        "- You can even build systems where one classification model feeds into another classification model. Imagine a user support system where the first classifier guesses the user’s language (English or German), the second classifier guesses which team is best suited to handle their request and a third classifier guesses whether or not the user is already upset to choose a ticket priority code.
