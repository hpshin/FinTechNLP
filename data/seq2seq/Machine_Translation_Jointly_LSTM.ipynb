This model achives our best perplexity yet, ~27 compared to ~34 for the previous model.\n",

It uses *attention*. \n",

The attention vector has the property that each element is between 0 and 1, and the entire vector sums to 1. We then calculate a weighted sum of our source sentence hidden states, $H$, to get a weighted source vector, $w$. \n",
