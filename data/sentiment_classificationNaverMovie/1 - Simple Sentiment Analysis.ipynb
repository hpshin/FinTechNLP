    "Reference : https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-sentiment-analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this series we'll be building a machine learning model to detect sentiment (i.e. detect if a sentence is positive or negative) using PyTorch. This will be done on Korean movie reviews, using the [Naver sentiment movie corpus v1.0](https://github.com/e9t/nsmc).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first notebook, we'll start very simple to understand the general concepts whilst not really caring about good results. Further notebooks will build on this knowledge and we'll actually get good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using a **recurrent neural network** (RNN) as they are commonly used in analysing sequences. An RNN takes in sequence of words, $X=\\{x_1, ..., x_T\\}$, one at a time, and produces a _hidden state_, $h$, for each word. We use the RNN _recurrently_ by feeding in the current word $x_t$ as well as the hidden state from the previous word, $h_{t-1}$, to produce the next hidden state, $h_t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$h_t = \\text{RNN}(x_t, h_{t-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have our final hidden state, $h_T$, (from feeding in the last word in the sequence, $x_T$) we feed it through a linear layer, $f$, (also known as a fully connected layer), to receive our predicted sentiment, $\\hat{y} = f(h_T)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below shows an example sentence, with the RNN predicting zero, which indicates a negative sentiment. The RNN is shown in orange and the linear layer shown in silver. Note that we use the same RNN for every word, i.e. it has the same parameters. The initial hidden state, $h_0$, is a tensor initialized to all zeros. \n",

    "\n",
    "The embedding layer is used to transform our sparse one-hot vector (sparse as most of the elements are 0) into a dense embedding vector (dense as the dimensionality is a lot smaller and all the elements are real numbers). This embedding layer is simply a single fully connected layer. As well as reducing the dimensionality of the input to the RNN, there is the theory that words which have similar impact on the sentiment of the review are mapped close together in this dense vector space. For more information about word embeddings, see [here](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/word-embeddings-transform-text-numbers/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The RNN layer is our RNN which takes in our dense vector and the previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$, which it uses to calculate the next hidden state, $h_t$.\n",

    "The `forward` method is called when we feed examples into our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each batch, `text`, is a tensor of size _**[batch size, sentence length]**_. That is a batch of sentences, each having each word converted into a one-hot vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may notice that this tensor should have another dimension due to the one-hot vectors, however PyTorch conveniently stores a one-hot vector as it's index value, i.e. the tensor representing a sentence is just a tensor of the indexes for each token in that sentence. The act of converting a list of tokens into a list of indexes is commonly called *numericalizing*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input batch is then passed through the embedding layer to get `embedded`, which gives us a dense vector representation of our sentences. `embedded` is a tensor of size _**[batch size, sentence length, embedding dim]**_.\n",
    "\n",
    "`embedded` is then fed into the RNN. In some frameworks you must feed the initial hidden state, $h_0$, into the RNN, however in PyTorch, if no initial hidden state is passed as an argument it defaults to a tensor of all zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RNN returns 2 tensors, `output` of size _**[batch size, sentence length, hidden dim]**_ and `hidden` of size _**[batch size, 1, hidden dim]**_. `output` is the concatenation of the hidden state from every time step, whereas `hidden` is simply the final hidden state. We verify this using the `assert` statement. Note the `squeeze` method, which is used to remove a dimension of size 1. \n",
